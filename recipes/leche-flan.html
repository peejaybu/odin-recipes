    <h4>Description</h4>

This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in the  menu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. It can also be added as a component to build other great tasting dessert creations.</em></p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>10 pieces eggs</li>
        <li>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater.</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire.</li>
        <li>Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.</li>
        <li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold.</li>
        <li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold.</li>
        <li>Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
