        <li>3/4 cups carrots julienned</li>
        <li>3 cups bean sprouts cleaned</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>3 cups Cooking oil</li>  
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pan and then scoop about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of cooking oil.</li>
        <li>When the oil becomes hot, saute the garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>Add the green onion, cabbage, and carrots. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put-in the bean sprouts, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well and then cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and then transfer the vegetables to a colander to drain the liquid. Let it cool down.</li>
        <li>Lay a piece of spring roll wrapper in a clean flat surface. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of vegetable mixture. Wrap the mixture by folding the opposite ends of the wrapper inward and then rolling the other side until a cylindrical shape is formed. Seal the edge by brushing the beaten egg mixture in the end of the wrapper. Repeat this step until the veggie mixture is consumed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the cooking oil in a deep cooking pot.</li>
        <li>When the oil becomes hot, put-in the spring rolls gently one at a time until the maximum capacity of the cooking pot is reached. For better results, try to limit the rolls by cooking around 5 to 6 pieces at a time.</li>
        <li>Deep fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until the wrapper turns light to medium brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried spring rolls from the pot and place in a plate lined with paper towel.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite spring roll dipping sauce.</li>
